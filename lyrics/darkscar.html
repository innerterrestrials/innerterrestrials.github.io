		<p>You need it, you need it<br>
You need this war stop your bleeding hearts and feed it<br>
Don’t fight it don’t fight it, don’t fight it<br>
We know what’s good for you, get used to it and like it<br>
<span id="more-211"></span><br>
You know the price, you know it burns<br>
You know the price, you know that it burns<br>
You knew the price, you knew that it would burn<br>
You know we can’t allow you to see the worm turn</p>
<p>Collateral, collateral, yes you! You qualify<br>
One day you may outlive your use<br>
Suffer the wrath of uncontrolled abuse<br>
You may get out of bed one day<br>
To find that you are in the way of progress<br>
And we cannot let that be<br>
There are ways to make you listen and the truth shall set you free</p>
