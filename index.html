                Inner Terrestrials are pleased to finally announce <a href="http://innerterrestrials.bigcartel.com/product/pre-order-new-it-cd-heart-of-the-free" title="Pre-order the long await new album from Inner Terrestrials">the release of our long awaited album <strong>Heart Of The Free</strong></a>. There have been many difficulties along the way, the biggest one being this disastrous situation we’re all living through. With no gigs in sight we took the decision to release it regardless so instead of touring we’ll be performing a free online album launch gig on Sunday 28TH February 2021 at 20.00hrs 8pm GMT streaming live from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2185870161543320" title="Inner Terrestrials Album Launch Livestream via Facebook">Facebook</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTyaLHimiKJQHoQhlnYqNow" title="Inner Terrestrials Album Launch Livestream via YouTube">YouTube</a>.
