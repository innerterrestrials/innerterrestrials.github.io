<p>With the evidence of your own eyes<br />
It’s happening, behind the spin is lies<br />
TV Studio lights go off<br />
The money men take off their masks and laugh at us
</p>

<p>
Murder in the name of<br />
Earth destruction in the name of<br />
Theft in the name of<br />
The poor left bereft in the name of
</p>

<p>
Deserts expand, forests become sand<br />
All in the name of<br />
Green valleys turn to dust and still we must<br />
Strive in the name of<br />
Murder in the name of<br />
Earth destruction in the name of<br />
Nobody stands in the way or has anything to say<br />
Against the tide of
</p>
<p>
Fanatical with greed, armed to the teeth<br />
Here march the armies of<br />
Until there’s nothing left we’ll sow the seeds of death<br />
And grow the gallows tree of
</p>
<p>
And when the green earth is grey,<br />
Choking on its last breath, you know what we’ll say<br />
God told us to do it, he made us create<br />
Armageddon in the name of progress<br />
Human nature made us do it, it made us create<br />
Armageddon in the name of progress<br />
It was greed made us do it, it made us create<br />
Armageddon in the name of progress
