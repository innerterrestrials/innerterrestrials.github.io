<p>
Up town, I was wandering around<br />
Two coppers clocked me and said “Here’s one for the pound”<br />
I told them that I knew my rights, and started to see red<br />
They laughed and got their truncheons out and this is what they said
</p>
<p>
“We run things in this neighbourhood<br />
And we don’t fuck about so you better be good<br />
No firm is as big as ours and we show no pity<br />
From the hills to the coast, all the towns and cities<br />
Are ruled by us with an iron grip<br />
You march to our drum and you live in our trip<br />
We’re the engine’s mechanics; we’ve got all the tools<br />
This is ‘Animal Farm’, we’re the pigs, we rule!”
</p>
<p>
"We Rule!"
</p>
<p>
One day down the dole, I was smelling something funny<br />
When the bastards lording over me would not give me my money<br />
Their power trip was obvious, malicious and low<br />
And a hag with a computer said “There’s one thing you should know…”<br />
</p>
<p>
“We run things in this neighbourhood<br />
And we don’t fuck about so you better be good<br />
No firm is as big as ours and we show no pity<br />
From the hills to the coast, all the towns and cities<br />
Are ruled by us with an iron grip<br />
You march to our drum and you live in our trip<br />
We’re the engine’s mechanics; we’ve got all the tools<br />
This is ‘Animal Farm’, we’re the pigs, we rule!”
</p>
<p>
"We Rule!"
</p>
<p>
In the old oak forest I was having a good time<br />
When a bastard in a hard hat came and said “All this is mine!”<br />
To build a tesco’s carpark I said “I’ll get in your way!”<br />
As they beat me up and locked me up, all that they could say was…
</p>
<p>
“We run things in this neighbourhood<br />
And we don’t fuck about so you better be good<br />
No firm is as big as ours and we show no pity<br />
From the hills to the coast, all the towns and cities<br />
Are ruled by us with an iron grip<br />
You march to our drum and you live in our trip<br />
We’re the engine’s mechanics; we’ve got all the tools<br />
This is ‘Animal Farm’, we’re the pigs, we rule!”
</p>
<p>
"We Rule!" </p>
