<p>Rest yourself, warmongering nut<br>
I can’t see where you’re coming from<br>
Your reasons make my head hurt<br>
With your false pretence of right and wrong<br>
One god is rich, another stern<br>
All believe right’s on their side<br>
To favour their cause, heaven’s wrath<br>
Spreads genocide, genocide!<br>
</p>

<p>Fight them back, we have to fight them back<br>
Though they come with violence, threats and bombs<br>
They’ve poisoned themselves, they’re not so strong<br>
The old ways are wrong and it can’t be long</p>

<p>Life is not a commodity, the power lies with you and me<br>
To fight them brothers and sisters as a family<br>
Fight them with creativity</p>

<p>Rockets fly and news reels lie<br>
Refugee camps overflow<br>
In squalor, degradation, slime<br>
People run to flee these crimes<br>
To live like this the only way<br>
They left their homes for good that day<br>
The day the missiles flew to town<br>
The day the gunmen came to stay</p>

<p>Fight them back...</p>

<p>Missiles fly and people die<br>
Innocents caught in the crossfire<br>
The normal people of this world<br>
Share the same simple desires<br>
Of food, shelter, happiness<br>
They aren’t ruthless empire-building yobs<br>
With food in our bellies and hope in our hearts<br>
I reject your law and shit your god!</p>
