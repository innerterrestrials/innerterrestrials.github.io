<p>Your conscience clean <br>
    In word thought and deed<br>
    Blissfully unburdened <br>
    By the constraints of empathy
    <span id="more-214"></span></p>

<p>Stepping up the war on the enemy<br>
    Stepping it up they're stepping up the war<br>
    Laying down the law on the enemy<br>
    Stepping it up they're stepping up the war</p>

<p>Just like it is on television<br>
    The agenda is set<br>
    Where bleeding hearts <br>
    Hold hands with stone cold derision<br>
    Now this is what you get, this is what you get!</p>

<p>Stepping up the war on the enemy<br>
    Stepping it up they're stepping up the war<br>
    Laying down the law on the enemy<br>
    Stepping it up they're stepping up the war</p>

<p>Imprisoned by mass media<br>
    Now you're well hooked upon the bate<br>
    A steady climate of hysteria<br>
    It could just make this nation great</p>

<p>Stepping up the war on the enemy<br>
    Stepping it up they're stepping up the war<br>
    Laying down the law on the enemy<br>
    Stepping it up they're stepping up the war on the enemy within</p>

<p>Stepping up the wear on the enemy<br>
    Stepping up the war on the enemy within</p>

<p>A world where you grass on your neighbours<br>
    While under surveillance in the street<br>
    There'll be no recompense when we smash you malcontents<br>
    Misfits stand in line you're obsolete</p>

<p>Stepping up the war on the enemy<br>
    Stepping it up they're stepping up the war<br>
    Laying down the law on the enemy<br>
    Stepping it up they're stepping up the war</p>
