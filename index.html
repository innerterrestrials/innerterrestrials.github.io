        	<!--<p>The website is currently under going a full redevelopment - in the meantime you can check out all the useful information at these various places:</p>-->
        	<p>Check out our latest <span class="lead"><a href="https://www.songkick.com/artists/210500-inner-terrestrials" title="Inner Terrestrials gig dates">gig dates</a></span> on songkick (you can track us on there too to get notifications when we add shows to it). We're adding more summer dates soon.</p>
        	<p>For CDs, vinyl, T-shirts, hoodies, patches, badges and all that merch - head over to the <span class="lead"><a href="http://innerterrestrials.bigcartel.com" title="Inner Terrestrials merch">online shop</a></span> on bigcartel. We have merch at every gig, but can't guarantee we'll have what you want cos there's a limited amount we can fit in the case!</p>
        	<p>To get in touch about bookings email <span class="lead"><a href="mailto:info[at]innerterrestrials.co.uk" title="email">info [at] innerterrestrials.co.uk</a></span> (change the [at] to an @, we have to write it like this to cut down on the spam)</p>

            <p>See you down the front. </p>
