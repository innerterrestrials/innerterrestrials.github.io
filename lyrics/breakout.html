<p>Don't want to be imprisoned by trickery and crippled by doubt<br>
    If you don't know the time I say it's time, I say it's time to<br>
    Time to break out<br>
    I've weighed in the chains there's no need for a key<br>
    Your machinations, power games they mean nothing, they mean nothing<br>
    To the heart of the free
    <span id="more-214"></span></p>

<p>You reason mine and yours by the just rule of law<br>
    But then everything is yours and also you control, you control<br>
    And you defy that law<br>
    And you're always near trying to divert my eyes<br>
    Trying to whisper in my ear, you think you can can fool me, you think you can school me<br>
    You think you can rule me by fear</p>

<p>This prison won't hold us, I see it in flames<br>
    Out from under your radar, way out of your range<br>
    BREAK FREE! Consciousness reclaimed</p>

<p>Deep down we all know though the conjured up smoke<br>
    Chokes our conversation with the ever, with the ever<br>
    With the ever moving flow</p>

<p>So so so so stop the chat, I must insist that you desist<br>
    This agenda's going nowhere that will help us, that can help us<br>
    To peacefully exist</p>

<p>This prison won't hold us, I see it in flames<br>
    Out from under your radar, way out of your range<br>
    BREAK FREE! Consciousness reclaimed</p>
