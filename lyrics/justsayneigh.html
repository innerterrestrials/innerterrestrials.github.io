<p>You used to be an angry man who resented evil plans<br />
Of the darker dreams that come from man<br />
Now all that stuffs cooked in a pan<br />
All your plans to help mankind have had to be left far behind<br />
You’re well out of your tiny mind, you’re just in the way</p>

<p>Just say neigh!</p>

<p>There used to be a time when I would say I would back you all the way<br />
But that was in the good old days when you were someone else<br />
Now you’re caning it and causing fights or in a coma, talking shite<br />
Mate you’re become a sorry sight, a liability</p>

<p>Just say neigh!</p>

<p>Refuges on the run from a world of wrong<br />
Lost to us where have all the warriors gone?</p>

<p>Ketamine, crack and smack my friend, hedonism that seems to have no end<br />
It’s driven thousands round the bend like watching family die<br />
Cooking it on drugs kills all your self-belief,<br />
You used to bite back now you’ve got no teeth<br />
And resistance is so much grief when you’re out of your nut</p>

<p>Just say neigh!</p>
