		<p>Some took a bible to the desert<br>
They burned with fires of faith in the scorched land<br>
And when the fighting stopped and the smoke cleared<br>
There was a blood soaked bible in the sand<br>
<span id="more-217"></span></p>
<p>In the name of the father<br>
In the name of the father by the divine grace of god<br>
In the name of the father by everything that’s good<br>
In the name of the father by the divine grace of good god – your god</p>
<p>There was a Koran in the mountains<br>
It promised absolution from all our sins<br>
It watched the fighting till the ammunition was spent<br>
Its pages torn and flapping in the wind</p>
<p>In the name of the father…</p>
<p>Well what went wrong we ask ourselves as we remember<br>
All of their words can’t have been lies<br>
While we were blinded by their endless threats and promises<br>
None saw the jakal in their eyes</p>
<p>In the name of the father…</p>
<p>Now it’s our problem, we’re the ones who gave them power<br>
We’ve made them the master of the field<br>
The spirits and the elements of nature and our pagan gods<br>
Were called the devil and we were forced to yield</p>
<p>To the name of the father…</p>
<p>A ship of fools sails on the ocean<br>
And we’ve made it lord and master of the seas<br>
But it’s getting heavy and one day it must sink<br>
And then all the world’s people might be free</p>
<p>In spite of the father…</p>
