<p>Why the fuck are you telling me what's for the best?<br>
    Sort yourself out, feather your nest and to hell with the rest<br>
    You're bang out of luck if you're struggling through a hard life<br>
    Don't own the ground, free to be exploited by the injustice that's rife
    <span id="more-214"></span></p>

<p>We servile masses walk blindly where we're lead,<br>
    So desperate to appease, till all self-respect has fled<br>
    We servile masses walk blindly where we're lead<br>
    To a lifetime on your knees, till the fire inside is dead</p>

<p>Fair is fair is so easy to say with a sword<br>
    &ldquo;But let's not dwell on the past it was so long ago&rdquo; say the ancient overlords<br>
    You're quick or you're dead is the message that they shout out<br>
    Others weakness is your opening, their weakness is your opening, so strike hard without doubt</p>

<p>We servile masses walk blindly where we're lead,<br>
    So desperate to appease, till all self-respect has fled<br>
    We servile masses walk blindly where we're lead<br>
    To a lifetime on your knees, till the fire inside is dead</p>

<p>Right in my face telling me how the world works<br>
    &ldquo;Be a good slave and bide your time, you'll get your perks&rdquo;<br>
    Why don't you rest your mouth? Because I've heard all I need to hear<br>
    Enough shit about monsters under the bed and how I should live my life in fear</p>

<p>We servile masses walk blindly where we're lead,<br>
    So desperate to appease, till all self-respect has fled<br>
    We servile masses walk blindly where we're lead<br>
    To a lifetime on your knees, till the fire inside is dead</p>
