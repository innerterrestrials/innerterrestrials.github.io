<p>Well this is a story about the war,<br />
this is the futures to unfurl.<br />
And this is about the fate of millions,<br />
under attack by evil's minions.</p>

<p>This song is about the fascist threat,<br />
and a history full of regret.<br />
And this is a tale of countless dead,<br />
because of the lies on which we're fed.</p>

<p>A white nightmare<br />
A white nightmare<br />
A white nightmare<br />
The great white nightmare</p>

<p>You know we're taught to believe in our sovereign rulers,<br />
just one of the lies on which we're nurtured.<br />
Patriotism, blind faith in the state,<br />
relate to xenophobia and race hate.</p>

<p>The innocents died when the war flags flew<br />
are scared human beings, no different from you<br />
In God and mercy's name, they'll have to be cleansed,<br />
the commies, the subverts, the gypsy, the jew.</p>

<p>A white nightmare<br />
A white nightmare<br />
A white nightmare<br />
The great white nightmare</p>

<p>You know they're still there fighting for a new world order,<br />
built on fear and children slaughtered.<br />
And I can't think what they hope to gain,<br />
when the rivers turn to blood, and joy turns into pain.</p>

<p>with a crooked pride in Germanic roots,<br />
swastikas, shaved head, steel toe capped boots.<br />
They're warped ideal is a Nazi nation,<br />
born of loss and bleak frustration.</p>

<p>A white nightmare<br />
A white nightmare<br />
A white nightmare<br />
The great white nightmare</p>

<p>Have they forgotten the lesson of the past?<br />
With their misplaced pride and their Aryan path.<br />
Can the rotten see that inside their heads,<br />
hatred grows and hatred spreads.</p>

<p>Before you realised in had begun,<br />
the world is under threat from Nazi scum.<br />
So on your feet now, do us right,<br />
it's time to spread the love, and block out all the lies.</p>

<p>A White nightmare<br />
A White nightmare<br />
A White nightmare<br />
The great white nightmare</p>

<p>You know I look around and I don't see mugs,<br />
who'll take this shit from fascist thugs.<br />
We need one heart, one soul, one nation,<br />
to save us all from annihilation.<br />
We suffered from too many wars,<br />
We must never break under their laws.<br />
We've been hurt enough, we'll take no more,<br />
We must defeat the fascist core.</p>

<p>A white nightmare<br />
A white nightmare<br />
A white nightmare<br />
The great white nightmare </p>
