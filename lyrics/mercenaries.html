<p>The law lies, extorts and steals<br>
    There is no justice there is just us<br>
    It cons, it loots, it deals<br>
    There is no justice there just us
    <span id="more-214"></span></p>

<p>It threatens and tortures with zeal<br>
    There is no justice there is just us</p>

<p>By force it dictates what's real<br>
    There is no justice there is just us</p>

<p>If complicit obedience isn't your thing<br>
    They'll send out the heavies to bring you in<br>
    Paid mercenaries, paid mercenaries, paid mercenaries<br>
    You will be be judged by the profit you bring<br>
    You'll be protected where the thief is king<br>
    By mercenaries, by mercenaries, by mercenaries</p>

<p>So big and brave<br>
    Hired muscle for the mainframe<br>
    Enforcing the dystopian dream<br>
    All aboard the gravy train</p>

<p>They're only doing their job<br>
    Following orders they feel no shame<br>
    To smash all resistance to wilful destruction<br>
    For their masters financial gain</p>

<p>If complicit obedience isn't your thing<br>
    They'll send out the heavies to bring you in<br>
    Paid mercenaries, paid mercenaries, paid mercenaries<br>
    You will be be judged by the business you bring<br>
    You'll be protected where the thief is king<br>
    By mercenaries, by mercenaries, by mercenaries</p>
