<p>Sometimes the world goes dark<br>
    But in the shadows we have no fear<br>
    When it's time to rock the place, tear it up and the fire burns<br>
    That's when you're always near
    <span id="more-214"></span></p>

<p>A true and solid friend<br>
    To watch your back and lend you a strong hand<br>
    On the long and winding roads<br>
    At home and in many a distant strand</p>

<p>It seems so sad <br>
    If all you care about is what you look like<br>
    Well who gives a toss? The crows are circling <br>
    Facile, superficial egotists wind your necks in</p>

<p>It may be so<br>
    There are no hero's any more<br>
    Ask yourself if there ever was, what's good in life? <br>
    To have friendship trust a solid crew<br>
    People who keep it real and say it true</p>

<p>It's all about the heart<br>
    Because after the rain<br>
    The vibrant earth springs forth its life force again<br>
    Son we won't grieve, no we won't cry<br>
    Every time we rock the place we can feel your spirit fly</p>

<p>Through fire and flames we remember your name<br>
    True heart remains WE REMEMBER YOUR NAME</p>
