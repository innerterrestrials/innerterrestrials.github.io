## Tales of Terror

### Boundaries

Break the boundaries, tear down the walls
Live as one, one love stand tall
Jack survives and giants fall
These are our streets, our world, our call
Live together, stand together
Learn to help and trust each other
The people on the ground we run this town
Stand as one! No creed no colour

The heart of the streets coming on strong!

It helps the real crooks to thrive
It suits the rich to cause a divide
They rub their hands when cultures clash
Division helps them earn their cash
Think about it, how do they get rich
While the people who run things live like shit?
Well it doesn’t have to be this way
If we could all unite, just unite! One day

The heart of the streets coming on strong!

This ruthlessness just brings us down
People screw and people frown
But when we stand on common ground
We run the streets of every town!

The heart of the streets coming on strong!

### In The Name Of The Father

Some took a bible to the desert
They burned with fires of faith in the scorched land
And when the fighting stopped and the smoke cleared
There was a blood soaked bible in the sand

In the name of the father
In the name of the father by the divine grace of god
In the name of the father by everything that’s good
In the name of the father by the divine grace of good god – your god

There was a Koran in the mountains
It promised absolution from all our sins
It watched the fighting till the ammunition was spent
Its pages torn and flapping in the wind

In the name of the father…

Well what went wrong we ask ourselves as we remember
All of their words can’t have been lies
While we were blinded by their endless threats and promises
None saw the jakal in their eyes

In the name of the father…

Now it’s our problem, we’re the ones who gave them power
We’ve made them the master of the field
The spirits and the elements of nature and our pagan gods
Were called the devil and we were forced to yield

To the name of the father…

A ship of fools sails on the ocean
And we’ve made it lord and master of the seas
But it’s getting heavy and one day it must sink
And then all the world’s people might be free

In spite of the father…

### Thirty Pieces Of Silver

Some took a bible to the desert
They burned with fires of faith in the scorched land
And when the fighting stopped and the smoke cleared
There was a blood soaked bible in the sand

In the name of the father
In the name of the father by the divine grace of god
In the name of the father by everything that’s good
In the name of the father by the divine grace of good god – your god

There was a Koran in the mountains
It promised absolution from all our sins
It watched the fighting till the ammunition was spent
Its pages torn and flapping in the wind

In the name of the father…

Well what went wrong we ask ourselves as we remember
All of their words can’t have been lies
While we were blinded by their endless threats and promises
None saw the jakal in their eyes

In the name of the father…

Now it’s our problem, we’re the ones who gave them power
We’ve made them the master of the field
The spirits and the elements of nature and our pagan gods
Were called the devil and we were forced to yield

To the name of the father…

A ship of fools sails on the ocean
And we’ve made it lord and master of the seas
But it’s getting heavy and one day it must sink
And then all the world’s people might be free

In spite of the father…
