<p>It’s time to make a stand<br />
All throughout this land<br />
It’s time we upped and showed a fight<br />
And put pay to their plans</p>

<p>Cos they hammer us with fear<br />
Through many a long year<br />
It’s time we upped and showed a fight<br />
And wiped away the tears</p>


<p>We shouldn’t have to beg<br />
To earn a meager crust<br />
We should fight them and their ideals<br />
‘Til their monuments are dust<br />
We shouldn’t have to feed<br />
Out of their bloody hands<br />
It’s time we upped and showed a fight<br />
And free the sacred land</p>
