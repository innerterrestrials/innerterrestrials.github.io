<p>Today's headline news<br>
    Is I'm running out of wood and I've got big holes in my shoes<br>
    Your business deals are irrelevant to me<br>
    Here is the score I don't work for you <br>
    You're wasting your time trying to tell me what to do<br>
    And I'm the one you say that lacks respect
    <span id="more-214"></span></p>

<p>You're all about the bling, you're all about the wedge<br>
    Me I'm happy by the fire and living freely by the hedge<br>
    I prefer the woods to your palaces and walls<br>
    I've never been in awe of your diamonds and pearls<br>
    All things being equal in this world<br>
    Your dragons hoard it has no real worth</p>

<p>On the last spring moon when the hawthorn blooms<br>
    Before the summer rain maybe I'll be back again<br>
    On the last spring moon when the hawthorn blooms<br>
    Before the summer rain maybe I'll be back again</p>

<p>I've had occasion to reflect,<br>
    That the more you steal the more you feel you must protect<br>
    Are you wealthy or just a thief at heart?<br>
    If I appear nonchalant <br>
    It's because I won't kiss arse and there is nothing here I want<br>
    I'll take my chances on the open road</p>

<p>You still keep coming to collect<br>
    But I don't owe you shit cos I was never in your debt<br>
    You can't force me to drink from a poisoned well<br>
    And the crap you try and make me eat is laughable <br>
    To me your ways are obsolete<br>
    You're the cloud that keeps the sun from my back</p>

<p>On the last spring moon when the hawthorn blooms<br>
    Before the summer rain maybe I'll be back again<br>
    On the last spring moon when the hawthorn blooms<br>
    Before the summer rain maybe I'll be back again</p>
