<p>Tyranny has come to seal your fate<br>
    Feel the embrace of the full and absolute power of the state<br>
    They'll protect their interest by any means <br>
    Don't close your eyes don't fall asleep theirs is a terrifying dream
    <span id="more-214"></span></p>

<p>Your throat their knife<br>
    How will you resist the unaccountable masters of your life<br>
    Scream all you want there'll be no one left to hear<br>
    Don't close your eyes don't fall asleep, the wind grows cold as they draw near<br>
    They come to feed the hate in man<br>
    We stop them here &ndash; NO PASARAN!<br>
    They shall not pass - NEVER AGAIN! NO PASARAN!</p>

<p>Our heads are in the sand but the hour is late<br>
    And the light grows dim wherever their shadow falls<br>
    They'll kill you where you stand if you won't collaborate<br>
    Don't close your eyes, don't fall asleep or they'll be coming for us all</p>

<p>A sociopathic plague and it's spreding fast<br>
    Will we stand witness to freedoms defeat?<br>
    There's only us to stop them, though the battle lines are vast<br>
    They'll fill our days with terror if we don't defend our streets</p>

<p>They come to feed the hate in man<br>
    We stop them here &ndash; NO PASARAN!<br>
    They shall not pass - NEVER AGAIN! NO PASARAN!</p>
