		<p>Thirty pieces of silver is that the going price<br>
Is that the magic bargain that turns you men to mice<br>
Well it seems so very cheap such a small price to keep us meek<br>
Distracted from the way so we’re alone and scared and weak<br>
<span id="more-214"></span></p>
<p>And the pain cuts like a knife when you feel that you’ve wasted your whole life<br>
Chasing up blood money through all those years of strife<br>
And all those years you worked never was it said that you had shirked<br>
You can leave something behind but it’s the emptiness that hurts</p>
<p>If you live set up for failure, you’ll tear yourself apart<br>
Anything is slavery if it isn’t in your heart<br>
Failure is your fear if you think the end is always near<br>
Sold a packaged slavery instead of being here</p>
<p>Pictures of my life flash by, a myriad in front of my eyes<br>
My heart is filled with pain, I don’t know where to lay the blame<br>
If I could live it all again, it wouldn’t be the same now as it was then<br>
I would take the opportunity to express my creativity<br>
If I could go right back to the start I’d drop the pretence and follow my heart<br>
I never did understand you could break free from the master plan<br>
Now that it seems too late, it’s beyond my power to outrun fate<br>
I realise it was true, I could have done what I wanted to do</p>
<p>So if thirty pieces of silver is a measure of your worth<br>
And the price of your existence down here on planet earth<br>
Unlike the demons from the pale, the truth in your heart will never fail<br>
So follow it, forget the rest, don’t let your soul go stale</p>
<p>Or the pain cuts like a knife….</p>
<p>If I could live it all again, it wouldn’t be the same now as it was then<br>
I would take the opportunity to express my creativity<br>
If I could go right back to the start I’d drop the pretence and follow my heart!</p>
