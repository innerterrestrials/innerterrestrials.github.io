		<p>Violence gives rise to violence<br>
Surely there is another way to break the silence<br>
It can be dangerous to hold your head up high<br>
And walk your road under the open sky<br>
In this battlefield<br>
<span id="more-208"></span></p>
<p>Terror, its best friend is terror<br>
There are those who’d create fear to last forever<br>
Well you’ll lose your heart when the good vibes drain<br>
When the hopes are dashed only fear remains<br>
In this battlefield</p>
<p>Suspicion breeds more suspicion<br>
And when closed minds peddle hate fearful listen<br>
Down the local pub they say “send them back!”<br>
May the rainbow fade to white and black<br>
In this battlefield</p>
<p>Resistance, I live resistance<br>
It’s the only way to protect my existence<br>
When the threats are made I stand my ground<br>
Defend myself with the freedom sound<br>
In this battlefield</p>
