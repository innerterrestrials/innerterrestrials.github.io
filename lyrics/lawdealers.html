<p>Smash down my door six in the morning come the law<br />
To protect me from myself and my wicked ways<br />
And relieve me of my draw</p>

<p>I grew some seed, I grew some seed<br />
While nature dies through corporate greed<br />
While you distribute dangerous drugs<br />
People in the third world die from need</p>

<p>Spare the lectures on what’s good for me<br />
With your phosphorous bombs and your “Zyklon-B”<br />
And your pharmaceutical companies<br />
And your biocide society</p>

<p>Let’s get it right, if we put the bricks and the bottles aside<br />
And talk about the truth<br />
What they represent has to crush the youth<br />
Toting guns, toting guns sposed to get the bad men on their toes<br />
Trigger-happy hooligans in uniforms<br />
Death follows where they go</p>

<p>Controlled substance abuse<br />
But what about the chemicals they use?<br />
Pesticide, insecticide, fossil fuel infanticide</p>

<p>There is no trust; everybody knows the law deals drugs<br />
There’s no respect, the people know that the state deals death<br />
This ain’t no joke everybody knows that the law punts dope<br />
Fear the rope, fear the rope, work for the firm or lose all hope!
