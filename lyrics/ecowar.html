<p>Fifty thousand acres a day<br>
    Of rainforest is lost<br>
    Forever destroyed<br>
    Profit for some but at what cost?
    <span id="more-214"></span></p>

<p>Thirty seven percent to timber harvest<br>
    Twenty eight percent agricultural expansion<br>
    Twenty one percent to wildfire<br>
    Fourteen percent to mineral extraction</p>

<p>As has been said before this is the eco war<br>
    This is the eco war, you know what you're fighting<br>
    Same as it was before this is the eco war<br>
    This is the eco war, you know what you're fighting</p>

<p>Sixty percent of all wild animals<br>
    Have disappeared in forty years<br>
    And many have gone forever<br>
    Surely a fact to fear</p>

<p>Thirteen percent to habitat loss<br>
    Thirty one percent habitat degredation<br>
    Sixteen percent to climate change<br>
    Forty percent to exploitation</p>

<p>As has been said before this is the eco war<br>
    This is the eco war, you know what you're fighting<br>
    Same as it was before this is the eco war<br>
    This is the eco war, you know what you're fighting</p>

<p>Contamination by man made chemicals<br>
    Affects every marine organism<br>
    The ocean is a dumping ground <br>
    For the effluent of consumerism<br>
    Rising acidity is killing the coral<br>
    Caused by fossil fuel pollution<br>
    And the run off from mass farming<br>
    While big business tries to shut down the solutions</p>

<p>As has been said before this is the eco war<br>
    This is the eco war, you know what you're fighting<br>
    Same as it was before this is the eco war<br>
    This is the eco war, you know what you're fighting</p>
