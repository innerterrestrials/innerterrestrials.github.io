<p>Righteous fiction in a dimension of make believe<br>
    Of tricks and fantasy<br>
    On this blank canvas you're always in ascendency<br>
    Painter of your destiny
    <span id="more-214"></span></p>

<p>Beautiful fable here is a place where you are free<br>
    To move with certainty<br>
    Metamorphosise and reinvent<br>
    One more celebrity among a million deities</p>

<p>I'm really taken with your hocus pocus<br>
    I'm mesmerised by the way you move in soft focus<br>
    This apparition's hyper real<br>
    Real enough to touch, real enough to taste, real enough to feel</p>

<p>Glitz and glamour, megapixel magic<br>
    Breath in that binary dust, the results could be tragic<br>
    Who here doesn't want to touch the dream?<br>
    When it looks so nice, it looks so neat, it looks so clean</p>

<p>Like some shining mythical vision<br>
    How did you predict my dreams with pin point precision?<br>
    I feel as though your hear it must be true <br>
    There's something here that pulls me in, a magnetic force draws me to you</p>

<p>I know so much it's like I've known you for years<br>
    Enough to nurture your vanity and play upon your fears<br>
    I'm right behind you all the time<br>
    And the more you eat from my hand the more you become mine</p>

<p>It glitters and shimmers, where Hell mimics Heaven<br>
    The avatars glimmer and where Janus beckons<br>
    You post yourself higher, the stars are your rating<br>
    The code is your empire, the future is waiting</p>
