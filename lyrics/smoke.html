<p>
Smoke, smoke fills my eyes<br />
As Babylon burns to ash in the fire of its lies<br />
Riot, riot did I hear you say?<br />
It’s only a matter of time; you know every dog has its day
</p>

<p>All of the youth shall witness the day that Babylon shall burn</p>

<p>Anger, I feel the anger burn<br />
And it hurts so much it makes my soul and stomach turn<br />
But the sun, the bright sun still shines<br />
And I give thanks for that, its blessings and I hope that there’s still time</p>

<p>All of the youth...</p>

<p>It’s time to heal and to fight this bile<br />
With a positive attack dropping bombs of sound in a South London style<br />
Because life, life is yours to live<br />
So big up the vibe and show the darkness what a warrior can give! </p>
