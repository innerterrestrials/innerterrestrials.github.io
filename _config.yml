# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  25 years on the road and stronger than ever, London’s legendary Inner Terrestrials are a stomping mix of dub, punk, ska, folk and general anarchic danceability. They get audiences all over the world going crazy, from Bristol to Berlin, from Warsaw to Tokyo and beyond.
