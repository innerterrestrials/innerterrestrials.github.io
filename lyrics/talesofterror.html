		<p>The great and the good built a house of cards<br>
It all feel down watch it all fall down<br>
Ice caps melt as the ordinance flies<br>
Poison in the air poison in the ground<br>
These men had a big plan<br>
A dream come true to profit the few<br>
To protect their wealth sticky hands in the till<br>
Bullets fly in distant lands<br>
<span id="more-203"></span></p>
<p>Tales of terror got me turning in my sleep<br>
Will this nightmare last forever? I hear broken mothers weep<br>
Tales of terror leave me cold in restless dreams of world war three<br>
And in the shadows the torture victims scream</p>
<p>Accusations fly, threats all the time<br>
Tales of terror, menace, crime<br>
Stay indoors it’s not safe outside<br>
Stand in line and stay in line<br>
Must go forward no way back<br>
Our ways are just and our aim is true<br>
They defied us, defied us, defied us… now we attack!</p>
<p>Tales of terror…</p>
<p>No not you just drink your tea<br>
And watch the news sat on your arse<br>
No need to soil those sticky hands<br>
Our troops will crush our enemies<br>
These men swarm like flies<br>
Around corruption greed and lies<br>
Fanatics, lunatics and crooks<br>
The weak must die, the strong must die</p>
<p>Tales of terror…</p>
