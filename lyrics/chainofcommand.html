<p>In the mason's lodge and the police station<br>
    In the bureaucracies of every nation<br>
    The deals are done, you are betrayed<br>
    You are defeated before you've ever had your say
    <span id="more-214"></span></p>

<p>No cause for alarm<br>
    You must be docile <br>
    While you are farmed<br>
    You must submit<br>
    To the chain of command</p>

<p>Here in the stalls you're trapped in tight<br>
    It only hurts more if you struggle, don't move, don't fight<br>
    Through the bars of the crush it's so obscene <br>
    That it's the men with the goads that rule your dreams</p>

<p>No cause for alarm<br>
    You must be docile <br>
    While you are farmed<br>
    You must submit<br>
    To the chain of command</p>

<p>Ground under the heel of the institution<br>
    Dare to scratch them you'll feel the retribution<br>
    You have everything to lose, your loss their gain<br>
    Your rebellious spirit will feel the pain</p>

<p>No cause for alarm<br>
    You must be docile <br>
    While you are farmed<br>
    You must submit<br>
    To the chain of command</p>

<p>You must submit<br>
    You must submit<br>
    You must submit<br>
    You must submit to the chain of command</p>
