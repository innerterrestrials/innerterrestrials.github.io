<p>
Break the boundaries, tear down the walls<br />
Live as one, one love stand tall<br />
Jack survives and giants fall<br />
These are our streets, our world, our call<br />
Live together, stand together<br />
Learn to help and trust each other<br />
The people on the ground we run this town<br />
Stand as one! No creed no colour
</p>
<p>
The heart of the streets coming on strong!
</p>
<p>
It helps the real crooks to thrive<br />
It suits the rich to cause a divide<br />
They rub their hands when cultures clash<br />
Division helps them earn their cash<br />
Think about it, how do they get rich<br />
While the people who run things live like shit?<br />
Well it doesnâ€™t have to be this way<br />
If we could all unite, just unite! One day
</p>
<p>
The heart of the streets coming on strong!<br />
</p>
<p>
This ruthlessness just brings us down<br />
People screw and people frown<br />
But when we stand on common ground<br />
We run the streets of every town!
</p>
<p>
The heart of the streets coming on strong!
</p>
